During the lectures, the prof sometimes talks about frequent exam questions. These can be found here.

- When solving a matrix you will have to solve it to the reduced echolon form, this is a lot easier to correct.
- Trick question: write the echolon form of "3x + 5y = 6". Because there is only one equasion, this equasion is already the echelon form.
- Linear transformations is ALWAYS on the exam.
