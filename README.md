# AI

2 projects during the course of the semester. (25 hours) (8/20 points, deadlines to be announced soon)

### Examination:

- Open-book exercise (50%)
- Closed-book theory (50%)

# Bewijzen en redeneneren

**A test at the start of every lecture** (once every two weeks). This test contains questions about all previous seen material. Counts for 5% per test. (total = 25%) Be there in time!

## Exercise session 

**Prepare all exercises beforehand.** The session is to clarify the ones that a lot of people had trouble with solving. The session is not sufficient to make all the exercises.

## Homework

**After every lecture a small homework assignment is given.** Send this in before the exercise session. (no grade) (toledo for specific assignment)

## Examination: (75%) 

- theoretical: answering questsions that are treated in the course material
- practical: solve NEW problems by applying the seen course material

# Declaratieve talen

## Exercise session Obligatory. 

**Review course material**, no need to prepare the exercises before.

## Quoted exercices: (25%)

- Prolog (12.5%): 8-9/11/2017 (temporary date!)
- Haskell (12.5%): 13-14/12/2017 (temporary date!)

## Examination: (75%)

Written exam: write a Prolog and Haskell program (taken on a school-pc tha runs linux)
*This course is known as one of the courses where the most people fail.*

# Lineaire algebra

## Home assignment

Pearson - always learning - my lab (part of your handbook)

## Examination:

- Algebra
- Differential equasion - ODE
- Differential equastion - PDE (extra classes)

# Logica

## Homework

Obligatory through LogicPalet can be done through the entire year.

## Quoted exercise

between 23-11 and 6-12 (5%)

## Examination (95%)

# Objectgericht programmeren

**Before every lecture, study the material that will be treated**. The lectures will be too fast to get stuck on the basics during a lecture. A rough understanding is crucial.

## Homework

After every lecture there is a homework assignment. This assignment is mandatory.

# Wiskunde I

## Homework

**Before every exercise sitting a set of exercises** (see toledo) should be finished
